This is a customized version of the LiquidCrystal_I2C Library designed to work with the Elefu Control Panel I2C LCD backpack.

To use it, extract the 'LiquidCrystal_I2C.h' folder into your arduino Libraries directory and restart your arduino IDE.

It is based on an open source version made by DFRobot: http://www.dfrobot.com/image/data/DFR0154/LiquidCrystal_I2Cv1-1.rar
